# Poker Game

These Python scripts simulate a simple poker game.

## Description

The game requires no user input beyond starting the game. This will then take a deck of cards and draw from it until 3 "enemies" and 1 "player" have cards. According to the standard poker rules, the winner is determined and a banner displaying the result is appended to the bottom of a generated image for bragging rights. The generated image also includes pictures of each card in each of the player's/enemy's hands. The program can then be rerun.
